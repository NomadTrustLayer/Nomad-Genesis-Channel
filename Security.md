## Reporting a Vulnerability

At 0L1 Labs, we take security seriously. We appreciate the security research community's efforts in helping us maintain a secure platform.

### How to Report

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in 0L1 Labs, please report it to us following these guidelines:

**DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until we've had a chance to address it.

### Contact

**Email:** security@0l1labs.com

**PGP Key:** [Coming soon - will be published here]

**Expected Response Time:** Within 48 hours

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible to help us understand and resolve the issue:

1. **Type of issue** (e.g., circuit vulnerability, smart contract exploit, frontend attack)
2. **Full path** of source file(s) related to the issue
3. **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
5. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
6. **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it
7. **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment:** We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment:** We'll assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
3. **Updates:** We'll keep you informed of our progress
4. **Resolution:** We'll work on a fix and deploy it
5. **Disclosure:** We'll coordinate public disclosure with you after the fix is deployed

## Scope

### In Scope

The following components are in scope for vulnerability reporting:

**Core Infrastructure:**
- Zero-knowledge circuits (Circom code)
- Solana smart contracts (Rust/Anchor)
- Frontend proof generation (JavaScript/React)
- API endpoints (when launched Q2 2026)

**Vulnerability Types:**
- Circuit vulnerabilities (proof forgery, nullifier reuse, etc.)
- Smart contract exploits (reentrancy, authorization bypass, etc.)
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Input validation issues
- Logic errors that could lead to security issues

### Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **OUT OF SCOPE**:

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks on infrastructure
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Spam or rate limiting issues
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to them directly)
- Issues requiring physical access to user devices
- Browser-specific bugs (report to browser vendors)
- Issues in test/development environments
- Previously reported or known issues

## Bug Bounty Program

### Current Status

**Bug Bounty Program launches Q2 2026** with a **$50K-$100K reward pool**.

### Reward Tiers (Q2 2026+)

Rewards will be based on severity and impact:

| Severity | Reward Range | Examples |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Critical** | $10,000 - $25,000 | Proof forgery, nullifier bypass, contract drain |
| **High** | $5,000 - $10,000 | Authorization bypass, key extraction, fund theft |
| **Medium** | $1,000 - $5,000 | Information disclosure, non-critical logic errors |
| **Low** | $250 - $1,000 | Minor issues with limited impact |

**Note:** Final reward amounts are at the discretion of 0L1 Labs and depend on:
- Severity and impact of the vulnerability
- Quality of the report
- Ease of exploitation
- Whether the issue was previously known

### Eligibility

To be eligible for a bounty:
- ✅ Be the first to report the vulnerability
- ✅ Follow responsible disclosure guidelines
- ✅ Provide sufficient detail to reproduce
- ✅ Not violate any laws or breach any agreements
- ✅ Not exploit the vulnerability beyond proof-of-concept
- ✅ Not publicly disclose before we've had a chance to fix

**Ineligible:**
- ❌ 0L1 Labs employees, contractors, or immediate family
- ❌ Reports generated by automated tools without validation
- ❌ Out of scope issues
- ❌ Duplicate reports

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

**Protecting Your Identity Secret:**
- Generate identity secrets only on trusted devices
- Never share your identity_secret with anyone
- Back up your identity_secret securely (encrypted storage)
- Clear browser storage when using public computers

**Wallet Security:**
- Use hardware wallets when possible
- Verify all transaction details before signing
- Keep wallet software updated
- Be cautious of phishing attempts

### For Developers

**Building on 0L1 Labs:**
- Always validate proofs on-chain before granting access
- Never trust client-side proof validation alone
- Implement rate limiting on proof submission endpoints
- Monitor for abnormal proof submission patterns
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow our integration security guidelines (coming Q2 2026)
